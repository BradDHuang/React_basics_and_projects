// Delightful JavaScript Testing

// Zero configuration testing platform
Jest is used by Facebook 
to test all JavaScript code 
including React applications. 

One of Jest's philosophies is 
to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. 

// We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, 
which in turn results in 
more stable and healthy code bases.
