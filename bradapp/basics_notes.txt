The <td> tag 
    defines a standard cell in an HTML table. 
    An HTML table has two kinds of cells: 
        Header cells - contains header information (created with the <th> element) 
        Standard cells - contains data (created with the <td> element)

Alternatively referred to as a fixed space or hard space, 
Non-Breaking SPace (NBSP) is used in programming, 
and word processing to create a space in a line that cannot be broken by word wrap. 
With HTML &nbsp; 
allows you to create multiple spaces that are visible on a web page and not only in the source code.
