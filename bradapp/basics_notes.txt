The <td> tag 
    defines a standard cell in an HTML table. 
    An HTML table has two kinds of cells: 
        Header cells - contains header information (created with the <th> element) 
        Standard cells - contains data (created with the <td> element)
      
        
&nbsp;        
Alternatively referred to as a fixed space or hard space, 
Non-Breaking SPace (NBSP) is used in programming, 
and word processing to create a space in a line that cannot be broken by word wrap. 
With HTML &nbsp; 
allows you to create multiple spaces that are visible on a web page and not only in the source code.


// return <p>{this.props.objectProps}</p>; // (at Text.js:13)
// const objectProps = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
// return (
        <Text // (at App.js:89)
            objectProps={objectProps}
        />);
Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {a, b, c}). 
If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
