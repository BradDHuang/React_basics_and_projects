The border-width property can have from one to 4 values 
(for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).
// e.g.
    border-width: thin medium thick 10px;
        top border is thin
        right border is medium
        bottom border is thick
        left border is 10px

Compared to display: inline, 
                the major difference is that 
            display: inline-block 
                allows to set a width and height on the element.
Compared to display: block, 
                the major difference is that 
            display: inline-block 
                does not add a line-break after the element, 
                so the element can sit next to other elements.

Specificity:

the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. 
Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.
