The border-width property can have from one to 4 values 
(for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).
// e.g.
    border-width: thin medium thick 10px;
        top border is thin
        right border is medium
        bottom border is thick
        left border is 10px

Compared to display: inline, 
                the major difference is that 
            display: inline-block 
                allows to set a width and height on the element.
Compared to display: block, 
                the major difference is that 
            display: inline-block 
                does not add a line-break after the element, 
                so the element can sit next to other elements.

Flexbox:
The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module 
(currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) 
aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space 
among items in a container, 
even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").

The main idea behind the flex layout 
is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) 
to best fill the available space.

The flexbox layout is direction-agnostic 
as opposed to 
the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). 

// Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, 
// while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

// W3C: World Wide Web Consortium(联盟).
// The W3C is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.

Specificity:

the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. 
Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.
