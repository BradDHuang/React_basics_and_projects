// AngularJS:

AngularJS extends HTML with new attributes.
AngularJS is perfect for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. 
It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.
// AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with 
Directives, 
and binds data to HTML with 
Expressions.

AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.
The ng-app directive 
    defines an AngularJS application.
The ng-model directive 
    binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
The ng-bind directive 
    binds application data to the HTML view.
// AngularJS directives are HTML attributes with an ng prefix.

// AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.


AngularJS expressions are written 
inside double braces: {{ expression }}.
// or, ng-bind="expression"
AngularJS will "output" data exactly 
where the expression is written.
// AngularJS expressions bind AngularJS data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.
// AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: 
// They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

// Unlike JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can be 
// written inside HTML.

// AngularJS expressions do NOT support conditionals, loops, and exceptions, 
// while JavaScript expressions do.

// AngularJS expressions support filters, while JavaScript expressions do not.


AngularJS modules 
define AngularJS applications.
// e.g.
// var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
AngularJS controllers 
control AngularJS applications.
// e.g.
// app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
//    $scope.firstName= "John";
//    $scope.lastName= "Doe";
// });

The ng-app directive 
defines the application, 
the ng-controller directive 
defines the controller.
