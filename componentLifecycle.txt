Each React component has several “lifecycle methods” 
that you can override to run code 
at particular times in the process. 

// Methods prefixed with Will are called right before something happens, 
// and methods prefixed with Did are called right after something happens.

Through lifecycle methods, we can then control what happens 
when each tiny section of UI renders, updates, 
thinks about re-rendering, and then disappears entirely.

Only class components have lifecycle methods.

// e.g.
// commonly used lifecycle methods:

    constructor()
    // The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted. 
    // When implementing the constructor for a React.Component subclass, 
    // call super(props) before any other statement. 
    // Otherwise, this.props will be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to bugs.
    // If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, 
    you don’t need to implement a constructor for your React component.
    // Typically, in React constructors are only used for 2 purposes:
        (1) Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state.
        (2) Binding event handler methods to an instance.
    
    render()
    // The render() function should be pure, 
    meaning that it does not modify component state, 
    it returns the same result each time it’s invoked, 
    and it does not directly interact with the browser.
    
    componentDidMount()
    // componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.
    // If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, 
    this is a good place to instantiate the network request.
    
    // An update can be caused by changes to props or state. 
    render()
    
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
    // componentDidUpdate() is invoked immediately after updating occurs.
    
The only method you must define 
in a React.Component subclass is called 
render(). 
// All the other methods are optional.
