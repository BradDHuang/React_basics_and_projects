npm test
create-react-app will run test on files which end with 
.test.js 
in any place inside 
src directory.

A test suite 
is a block of unit tests 
that are all closely related; 
// they test the same function or similar parts of our code base.

We introduce a test suite in 
Jest 
using describe()

Each individual unit test is called 
a “spec”.

Jest makes it natural to write specs by containing them in a function called 
it()
