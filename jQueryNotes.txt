jQuery is a JavaScript Library.

jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.


What is jQuery?

jQuery is a 
lightweight, 
"write less, do more", 
JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks 
that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, 
and wraps them into 
methods 
that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like 
AJAX calls and 
DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

    HTML / DOM manipulation
    CSS manipulation
    HTML event methods
    Effects and animations
    AJAX
    Utilities
    
Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.


Why jQuery?

extendable.


Will jQuery work in all browsers?

The jQuery team knows all about 
cross-browser issues, 
and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. 
jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.


There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

    Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
    
    Include jQuery from a CDN (Content delivery network), like Google
    
    
// With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.


why not having type="text/javascript" inside the <script> tag?

This is not required in HTML5. 
JavaScript is the 
default 
scripting language 
in HTML5 and in all modern browsers!
